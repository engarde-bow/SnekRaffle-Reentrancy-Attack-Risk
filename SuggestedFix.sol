// To mitigate the reentrancy vulnerability, you could follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, where you perform any external calls after all state changes have been made. Here’s how you could refactor the code:

# Store the balance to be sent in a local variable
balance_to_send: uint256 = self.balance

# Update the state before making the external call
self.recent_winner = recent_winner
self.players = []
self.raffle_state = RaffleState.OPEN
self.last_timestamp = block.timestamp
rarity: uint256 = random_words[0] % 3
self.tokenIdToRarity[ERC721._total_supply()] = rarity 
log WinnerPicked(recent_winner)
ERC721._mint(recent_winner, ERC721._total_supply())

# Make the external call after all state changes
send(recent_winner, balance_to_send)

// Additionally, In the below code, send returns a boolean indicating whether the transfer was successful. If the transfer fails, an assertion error is thrown with the message “Transfer failed”. This provides a similar level of safety to the transfer function in Solidity.

def fulfillRandomWords(request_id: uint256, random_words: uint256[MAX_ARRAY_SIZE]):
    index_of_winner: uint256 = random_words[0] % len(self.players)
    recent_winner: address = self.players[index_of_winner]
    balance_to_send: uint256 = self.balance

    # Update the state before making the external call
    self.recent_winner = recent_winner
    self.players = []
    self.raffle_state = RaffleState.OPEN
    self.last_timestamp = block.timestamp
    rarity: uint256 = random_words[0] % 3
    self.tokenIdToRarity[ERC721._total_supply()] = rarity 
    log WinnerPicked(recent_winner)
    ERC721._mint(recent_winner, ERC721._total_supply())

    # Make the external call after all state changes
    success: bool = send(recent_winner, balance_to_send)

    # Check that the funds were successfully sent
    assert success, "Transfer failed"
