// In the fulfillRandomWords function, you’re using the modulus operator (%) with the length of the players array. If the players array is empty, this will result in a division by zero error.

// Here is the vulnerable code:

index_of_winner: uint256 = random_words[0] % len(self.players)

// To mitigate this vulnerability, you could add a check to ensure the players array is not empty before this operation. Here’s how you could refactor the code:

assert len(self.players) > 0, "No players in the raffle"
index_of_winner: uint256 = random_words[0] % len(self.players)

// In this code, an assertion checks that the players array is not empty. If the players array is empty, an assertion error is thrown with the message “No players in the raffle”. This prevents the function from causing a division by zero error.
